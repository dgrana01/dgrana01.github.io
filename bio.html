				<p>	My Twitter handle is @trigaDometry, and I live in two worlds. Growing up as a half-blood wizard has exposed me to many different experiences that have shaped who I have become.	</p>
				<p>	My wizarding family, you've probably heard, is one of the most prominent quidditch families in history. Although quidditch is clearly in my blood, I won't be following in my family's footsteps, but the sport has still influenced my life deeply. It has taught me teamwork, leadership, competition, and dedication. There are so many lessons that I learned on the pitch that couldn't be learned anywhere else.	</p>
				<p>	The other side of my family is more likely to make broomsticks than to ride them. Although their muggle techniques may seem archaic, my family is rather innovative and creative. Most are titled engineers, builders, or makers of some sort. It is from this side of my family that I derive my handiness, craftiness, and passion for making.	</p>
				<p>	As my two worlds collide, I find myself with an incredible passion for tha art of wand making. I aim to reach the same level of expertise and influence in this field as both of my families have shown in their own.	</p>
