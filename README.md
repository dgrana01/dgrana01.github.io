ASPECTS THAT HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED:
-All files including directories are in you repo dgrana01.github.io
-Used Git constantly (with help getting set up): committing with meaningful messages and pushing to GitHub.
-my README.md file briefly describes my work.
-Used way more than 5 rules in my CSS file.
-All pages passed the official HTML5 specifications with no errors.
-All CSS files passed the official CSS validation with no errors.
-I have included the 3 pages with exact file name: index.html, resume.html, and bio.html
(1 point) An index.html page hosted in your Tufts CS account that redirects to your actual website on GitHub.
-I didn not use JavaScript, jQuery, or any front-end framework.


ASPECTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED:
-I HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH THE ALIGNMENT OF THE BUTTONS ON THE INDEX PAGE
-I HAD TROUBLE WITH LAB 3 GETTING SET UP IN GITHUB, SO I WASN'T ABLE TO USE GIT CONSTANTLY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS, JUST TOWARDS THE END

I DID NOT COLLABORATE ON DISCUSSED THE ASSIGNMENT WITH ANYONE.

ESTIMATING, IT PROBABLY TOOK 5 OR 6 HOURS TO FINISH THIS WEBSITE (THAT INCLUDES DRAFTING THE PAGES, DESIGNING THE WEBSITE, CODING THE CONTENT, STYLING THE PAGE, AND PUSHING TO GITHUB)
